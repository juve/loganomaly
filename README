This is a simple tool for monitoring log files for anomalies. It is similar to
logwatch, but much simpler.

It takes a file containing a list of regular expressions to ignore (one per line)
and bashes them against the log file(s) specified. If there are any lines in the
logfile that do not match one of the regular expressions, they will be collected
and printed to stdout.

If you run this in cron, it will send you an email when an anomaly is detected.

The tool saves the offset into the log so that it will not send duplicate warnings
for the same log messages. It uses the inode number of the file and the offset to
determine when the log file has been changed, truncated or rotated. This information
is stored in a state database.

You can invoke the tool with -t to run in testing mode. In testing mode log state
information is not saved to the state database.
